Monolith users can now swap ERC/ETH-20 tokens straight from the app & at the best rates, thanks to their ParaSwap integration.

Monolith — a non-custodial contract wallet paired with a debit card to spend your ETH & ERC-20 in real life — just released **an integration of ParaSwap in the wallet mobile application** to facilitate their users’ swaps. It marks another milestone for both projects to facilitate easy access to a clear and convenient token exchange service.


### The Monolith Account


Monolith offers a contract wallet to help users secure their assets, as well as a visa debit card so they can spend conveniently. It effectively provides an Ethereum wallet one step away from a purchase in the real-world through the card.

With the addition of ParaSwap (v2), Monolith users can now swiftly exchange ETH & ERC-20 tokens and access different decentralized finance services in a few taps.

The implementation of ParaSwap v2 with our improved MultiPath enables Monolith users to switch from one DeFi protocol to another with minimal friction & efficient gas utilization.


While the ParaSwap fee contract is now live, the current Monolith integration runs without any extra fee — making it one of the most cost-efficient swap services available on mobile.


The Monolith team took great care in making the experience as easy to understand as possible. They included a USD-based dollar estimation on each side of the trade to help their users understand slippage and included color-labeled warnings when the slippage is over 1.5%.
